Linux kernel and the RapidIO driver
===================================

1.0 Kernel Command Line

The standard Linux RIO driver reads the kernel command line to look for the
'riohdid' parameter, if any.  This value is used to specify the default
host device id of each mport (hardware endpoint) on the board.

    riohdid=[<int>]+

There is provision for multiple hardware endpoints, but none of the current
boards makes use of that feature.

2.0 U-Boot DTS Parameter Settings

Many parameters to configure the AXXIA RIO driver are stored in the '.dts'
file (DTB blob) for the board.  An example configuration for one of the
AXXIA RIO devices might look like the following:

        rio0: rapidio {
                index = <0>;
                enabled = <1>;
                #address-cells = <2>;
                #size-cells = <2>;
                compatible = "axxia,rapidio-delta";
                device_type = "rapidio";
                reg = <0x0020 0x20142000 0x1000>; /* SRIO Conf region */
                ranges = <0x0 0x0 0x0031 0x00000000 0x0 0x40000000>;
                interrupt-parent = <&MPIC>;
                interrupts = <30 0x2 /* NCP_INTR_MPIC_SRC_AXIS_SRIO */>;
                outb-dmes = <2 0x00000003 1 0x00000000>;
                inb-dmes = <32 0xffffffff 0 0x00000000>;
        };

The parameters of this block are defined as follows:

2.1 index = < <int> >;

    Specify which instance of the AXXIA RIO endpoint is being initialized
    for the kernel.  Some AXXIA chip sets include multiple SRIO modules,
    and it is possible to initialize and load multiple endpoints to the
    kernel.

2.2 enabled = < <int> >;

    Specify whether the corresponding device instance is enabled/available.
    Usually the value of this item is filled in by UBoot directly.

2.3 #address-cells = < <int> >;

    Specify number of 32-bit values needed for an address in this section
    of the DTB file e.g. in "ranges" attribute.

2.4 #size-cells = < <int> >;

    Specify number of 32-bit values needed for a size in this section of
    the DTB file e.g. in "ranges" attribute.

2.5 compatible = "axxia,rapidio-delta";
    device_type = "rapidio";

    'Type' parameters used to associate one of the blocks of the '.dts'
    file with a specific kernel driver instance.

2.6 reg = < <int 0> <int 1> <int 2> >;

    Specify the AXI address and size of the SRIO Configuration block used
    to page through and read the SRIO Space associated with this hardware
    device endpoint.  <int 0> is the upper 32-bits of the address,
    <int 1> is the lower 32-bits of the address, and <int 2> is the size
    of the block (which must be at least 4KB).

2.7 ranges = < <int 0> <int 1> <int 2> <int 3> <int 4> <int 5> >;

    Specify the AXI address and size of the SRIO Space associated with this
    hardware device endpoint.  <int 2> is the upper 32-bits of the address,
    <int 3> is the lower 32-bits of the address. <int 4> is the upper 32-bits
    of the size, and <int 5> is the lower 32-bits of the size.

2.8 interrupt-parent = <&intControl>;
    interrupts < <int 0> <int 1> >;

    Specify the interrupt vector appropriate to this hardware device
    endpoint, and the associated interrupt controller.

2.9 outb-dmes = < <int 0> <int 1> <int 2> <int 3> >;

    Specify the number and kind of DMEs available for Type 11 outbound
    messaging by this hardware device endpoint.  Different versions of
    the AXXIA chips may include more or fewer DMEs.

        <int 0> is the number of DMEs for outbound multi-segment messages
        <int 1> is the bitmask showing which of the outbound multi-segment
                DMEs is working on this platform
        <int 2> is the number of DMEs for outbound single-segment messages
        <int 3> is the bitmask showing which of the outbound single-segment

    This attribute is optional.  Default value is <2 0x3 1 0x1>.

2.10 inb-dmes = < <int 0> <int 1> <int 2> <int 3> >;

    Specify the number and kind of DMEs available for Type 11 inbound
    messaging by this hardware device endpoint.  Different versions of
    the AXXIA chips may include more or fewer DMEs.

        <int 0> is the number of DMEs for inbound multi-segment messages
        <int 1> is the bitmask showing which of the inbound multi-segment
                DMEs is working on this platform
        <int 2> is the number of DMEs for inbound single-segment messages
        <int 3> is the bitmask showing which of the inbound single-segment
                DMEs is working on this platform

    This attribute is optional.  Default value is <32 0xffffffff 0 0x0>.
