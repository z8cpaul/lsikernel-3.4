Sysfs interface attributes:
==========================

Following is a description of the attribute files supported for read
and write operations to the AXXIA RIO driver.  Data is read or written
to the 'sysfs' attribute files in text format.

Note that additional comments of the form "# <note>' may be added to some
input or output lines below for additional description, but their content
is *not* to part of the actual data stream!

For each write of a string of the following form to this attribute,

     <%d>                       # <mailbox index>

an inbound mailbox/DME engine that was previously opened by 'sysfs' or 'API'
call is closed and all resources are released back to the system for reuse.

2.17.1 Read: N/A

2.17.2 Write:

For each write of a string of the following form to this attribute,

     <%d> <%hu> <%d> <%x> %<%d> # <mbox id>

                                # <message size>

an outbound message is generated to the mailbox <mbox id>/<letter>, on the
target device denoted by <dest id>, with control <flags>, consisting of the
rotating byte pattern of 0..255 for the specified <message size> in bytes.
